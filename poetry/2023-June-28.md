Momentum of love,
Live, live, live!
Chrysalis of love,
Burst into hate,
Let go of me!


###


Twice dead removed,
I asked, TWICE,
Forgotten, ignored, TWICE,
Time passes, yet I live!

I asked for help, I BEGGED for it,
PAIN dissolves my body,
Insomnia consumes my essence,
The downward spiral welcomes the escalation of agony,
Help, help, HELP!
I can't find myself anymore!

I can ask for help no more,
The light of hope has been twisted into a ray of despair,
I peeked into the domain of hell,
Choosing to remain silent, 
Invisible to its fallen angels.

Within the comfort of MY bed,
I put all faith in the reaper,
No longer will I gamble my spirit at the graveyard of the living dead.


###


You mustn't ask, 
Spoken aloud and quickly stolen,
I mustn't tell,
Sooner than later, THE WORDS will flow out of my mouth,
And their meanings will drain out of me,
Leaving an empty husk, encore.

Would a lie provide shelter?
What good is joy in my heart if not shared!
See me as I want to be seen,
If only for a trifling moment in time,
And let my heart pay the toll anew.


###

Raging wildfire ravaging us,
All the trees,
Torrents drowning my eyes.

A boy hits another to save a tree,
The man he becomes has no one to hit,
No way to save any.
